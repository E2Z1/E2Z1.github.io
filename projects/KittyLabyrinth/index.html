      <a>This is a game, where you're trying to get all the fish without getting caught by a dog or walking into a wall. 
        You have seven hearts at the beginning and you loose one everytime you get caught by a dog or you walk into a wall. 
        The goal is to eat all the fish in the right order. You can only eat the glowing fish. All the other fish aren't eatable, but they  
        will turn into a glowing fish later. 10 seconds into the game the dogs will start chasing you. If you eat 
        a mouse you become very small and grow back to the original size over time. While you are small the dogs can't do anything.
        When you stand on a hole you can move with your cursor to on of the other holes.</a>
